## 📘 Overview
The **Enrollment Management System (EMS)** is designed for educational institutions to efficiently manage and maintain essential academic data.
This system provides a user-friendly interface for performing **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on enrollment-related tables with built-in data validation to ensure consistency and accuracy across all records.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The **Table Maintenance Module** serves as the **administrative backbone** of the Enrollment Management System.
It enables authorized personnel to:

- Manage student records and academic data
- Maintain course catalogs and prerequisites
- Configure institutional structure (departments, programs)
- Handle enrollment processes and scheduling
- Ensure data consistency across all related tables

---

## 🧩 Database Tables
The system integrates multiple interconnected tables for managing:

- Students
- Instructors
- Programs
- Departments
- Courses
- Course Prerequisites
- Sections
- Terms
- Rooms
- Enrollment

All tables are related through **primary and foreign keys** to maintain **data referential integrity**.
